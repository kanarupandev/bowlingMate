Scan this video for cricket bowling deliveries.

A bowling delivery is: a person running up and throwing/bowling a ball with an overarm action.

For EACH delivery you find, note the timestamp when the ball is released (arm at highest point).

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only):
{
  "found": true,
  "deliveries_detected_at_time": [6.2, 18.5, 37.1],
  "total_count": 3
}

If no deliveries found:
{
  "found": false,
  "deliveries_detected_at_time": [],
  "total_count": 0
}

IMPORTANT:
- Look for ANY bowling-like arm action
- Include deliveries even if partially visible
- Timestamps in ascending order
- Return ALL deliveries found in the video
